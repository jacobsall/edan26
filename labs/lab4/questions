1.	the atomic has a lock addl, lock has some near hardware mutex lock (cpu gets exlusive ownership of cache). More than just an instruction! nonatomic just has a movl

2.	we have moved calculation for amount to push

3.	(https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic/memory_order) (https://www.internalpointers.com/post/understanding-memory-ordering) memory_order_seq_cst anv√§nds av atomics. Sequentially consistent, threads observe all modifications in the same order.

4.	It preserves atomicity, but is no longer thread safe. Should be cool?

5.	Should be faster since less work is done, no consistency is being enforced
